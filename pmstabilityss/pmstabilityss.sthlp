{pstd}{cmd: pmstabilityss} computes the minimum sample size required for the development of a new clinical prediction model targeting precise individual risk estimates as proposed by Riley et al. 2024.
{cmd: pmstabilityss} can be used to calculate the minimum sample size for the development of models with a binary outcome.

{phang}
We wish to develop a clinical prediction model to predict low birthweight. 
Consider that we have conducted a pilot study for our planned model development study. 
We will feed this dataset to {cmd: pmstabilityss}. 

{pstd}Using the lbw dataset as our example pilot data we can calculate some starting values for our sample size calculations. 
In particular we need an idea of the expected prevalence of our outcome of interest, a potential lower bound for how we might expect the model to perform in terms of the c-statistic, 
and some relative weights for the potential effect of each variable to be included in our new model (assuming no variable selection procedures). {p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. }{stata predict pr}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. }{stata roctab low pr}{p_end}

{pstd}Now we can use {cmd: pmstabilityss} to estimate the expected precision of individual risk estimates if we developed our new model on a sample of the same size as our pilot study data, 
using the following command.
Note we have set the expected relative effect of each predictor to the value seen in our pilot study.{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. }{stata pmstabilityss age lwt smoke ptl ht ui ftv, prev(.3122) cstat(.7382) beta(-.04328385  -.01433844    .5538123   .59443784   1.8720949   .73935229    .0235853)}{p_end}

{pstd}Given the summary table and particularly the instability plot, we would expect considerable uncertainty in individual risk estimates from a new model developed using a sample of this size (N=189). 
Let us compare this to what we would expect when using the recommended sample size using {cmd:pmsampsize}. 
To do this we can use the {opt pmss} option as below. 
{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. }{stata pmstabilityss age lwt smoke ptl ht ui ftv, prev(.3122) cstat(.7382) beta(-.04328385  -.01433844    .5538123   .59443784   1.8720949   .73935229    .0235853) pmss nodraw}
{p_end}

{pstd}While uncertainty in individual risk estimates is reduced somewhat by using the higher N recommended by {cmd:pmsampsize} (N=388) there is still large uncertainty, 
particularly for those with higher outcome probabilities.  
We can input an N that we believe it is feasible to obtain from our new study using the {opt n()} option. 
{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. }{stata pmstabilityss age lwt smoke ptl ht ui ftv, prev(.3122) cstat(.7382) beta(-.04328385  -.01433844    .5538123   .59443784   1.8720949   .73935229    .0235853) pmss n(1000) nodraw}
{p_end}

{pstd}At N=1000 there is much lower uncertainty in individual risk estimates with a median interval width of 0.08.  
We could also set a target width and allow {cmd: pmstabilityss} to calculate the required N to achieve this target.
To do this we must specify two options, first {opt pcutpoints()} and second {opt pciwidth()}. 
The following command specifies a target interval width of 0.1 for individuals with probabilities less than 0.3, 
and a target width of 0.2 for those with probabilities above 0.3. 
{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. }{stata pmstabilityss age lwt smoke ptl ht ui ftv, prev(.3122) cstat(.7382) beta(-.04328385  -.01433844    .5538123   .59443784   1.8720949   .73935229    .0235853) pmss pcut(0.3 1) pci(0.1 0.2) nodraw}
{p_end}

{pstd}Required sample size is significantly increased to achieve our target, but uncertainty is also dramatically reduced inline with our target.
We can also examine uncertainty in individual risk estimates across subgroups of a particular variable using the {opt subgroup()} option. 
The following command additonally asks {cmd: pmstabilityss} to investigate uncertainty by smoking status. 
{p_end}
